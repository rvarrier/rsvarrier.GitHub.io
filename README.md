## About me
Hi, I am a postdoc currently at the [FINN lab](https://thefinnlab.github.io/) in Dartmouth College, USA. I did my PhD under in the lab of Prof. Philipp Sterzer at Charité-Universitätsmedizin, Berlin (Germany) as part of the graduate programme at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Berlin, and my Master at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I also hold a Bachelor's degree (B.Tech) in Biotechnology from NIT Warangal (India), 

## Topics that excite me
How real-world context influences perception and action is a topic that I am particularly interested in - some of these contextual effects vary highly across individuals (e.g., how one bad incident at the start of the day can drastically change our experiences and behaviours during a whole day) whereas others may be common across a large group of people for a certain period (how differently people interpreted friendly gestures like handshakes during the COVID-19 pandemic). Yet some others can be more permanent (e.g. social norms in different cultures). Additionally, not everyone reacts to/ is affected by a context in the same way - depending on clinical and personality traits (social skills, beliefs about the goodness of the world etc.), both our experiences and reactions in the world can be vastly different. I would like to explore these using a combination of psychophysics, non-invasive neurophysiology (eye-tracking, skin conductance etc.) and fMRI.

## Research experience
In my ongoing post-doctoral work, I use [simple animations](https://www.tinyurl.com/psyanimsocial) to study how everyone sees social interactions in the world - in particular, (what makes an animation social)[https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2791682] (manuscript in prep), how this differs across individuals, and [how the brain processes social information](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/42/49/9211?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JNeurosci_TrendMD_0) - especially at various levels of social evidence (data being analysed). For my PhD, I studied how perception shifts after a state of uncertainty induced by feedback manipulation - I showed that this has sustanined effects as evidenced by  [a perceptual shift towards prior beliefs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41954-z) and [more corrupted stimulus representation in sensory areas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301889).
